			<h1>Roasted Black Sea Bass with Fresh Tomato Salsa</h1>   
		      <ul>
		        <li>Filets of black sea bass (<em>other fish like tilapia or salmon, sole or halibut, flounder or cod, arctic char will also work. It'll work for fish filets that are thick or thin, white or pink, skin-on or skinless, as well as fish steaks and even whole fish. The only thing that will vary is the cooking time, which will be longer for thicker pieces of fish.</em>) ~1/4 lb is generally a good portion per person.</li>
		        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
		        <li>Baking sheet</li>
		        <li>Parchment paper or aluminum foil (optional)</li>
		        <li>Paper towels</li>
		        <li>Spoon (optional)</li>
		        <li>Oven mitt</li>
		        <li>Spatula</li>
		      </ul>
	        <p>Preheat oven to 450˚F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Pour a drop of extra virgin olive oil onto the prepared baking sheet and rub it in with your hand or a paper towel. Pat fish filets dry with paper towels. (<em>This will prevent food from sticking and make cleanup easier.</em>) Sprinkle fish filets with sea salt and drizzle them with extra virgin olive oil. As you dry each filet, lay it on the prepared baking sheet, being sure to leave a little space between filets, as this will help them to cook evenly. If your fish filets have skin on them, lay the filets skin side-down on the baking sheet. (<em>The skin will come off easily once the fish is cooked.</em>) (<em>Roughly 1-2 teaspoons of oil per small fish filet; about 2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon per large filet. You basically want to use enough oil to coat the top of the fish. If desired, you can spread the oil over the fish filets using the back of a spoon or your own clean fingers.</em>)
	        </p>  
	        <p>
	        Place baking sheet in the oven and cook until fish filets are fully cooked. For black sea bass, it will take ~10 minutes to cook.Very thin fish, like sole, can take as little as 6-8 minutes to cook. Here’s the best way to check if fish is done cooking: when you suspect that the fish might be ready, carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven. Medium-thick fish filets (like striped bass) can take closer to 12 minutes, while thicker filets (cod, halibut) may take around 15 or 16 minutes. Note, however, that these cooking times are only guidelines, and that they can always vary depending on the size of the fish filets and the strength of your oven. (<em>Be sure to close the oven door promptly.</em>) Press on the fish with the back of a spoon or with your finger. (<em>Make sure your hands are clean and be careful, as the fish may be hot.</em>) If the fish flakes apart easily, it’s cooked. If the fish still seems quite firm, as if it’s pushing back at you rather than falling apart, then it needs to cook a little longer. (<em>Fish filets cook quickly, so you should check on them again every couple minutes.</em>) 
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        When the fish filets are done cooking, gently transfer them to serving plates using a spatula. If you don’t have a spatula, try using a couple large serving spoons. If you want, you can spoon some of the pan juices over the fish. (<em>The juices are very flavorful.</em>)</p>

 			<h1>Eggplant Rigatoni</h1>
		      <ul>
		        <li>1 medium eggplant, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
		        <li>1 pint cherry/grape tomatos</li>
		        <li>Lots of garlic</li>
		        <li>1 pound rigatoni pasta</li>
		        <li>olive oil</li>
		        <li>red pepper flakes</li>
		        <li>parmesan cheese</li>		        
		        <li>salt, pepper</li>
		      </ul>
      		<p>
        		Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl combine the eggplant, cherry tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Spread the vegetables out in an even layer on the baking sheet. Roast in the oven until the vegetables are tender and the eggplant is golden, about 35 minutes.Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until tender but still firm to the bite, stirring occasionally, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain pasta into a large bowl and reserve 1 1/2 cups of the cooking liquid. Transfer the roasted vegetables to a pan,adding the pasta cooking liquid 1/2 cup at a time until the pasta is saucy.  Add the torn mint leaves and extra-virgin olive oil. Combine with the pasta and add the Parmesan.  <em>Inspired by a recipe from Giada De Laurentiis</em>
