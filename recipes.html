      <h4>Main Courses</h4>
      <div>
        <h5>Roasted Black Sea Bass with Fresh Tomato Salsa</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Filets of black sea bass (<em>other fish like tilapia or salmon, sole or halibut, flounder or cod, arctic char will also work. It'll work for fish filets that are thick or thin, white or pink, skin-on or skinless, as well as fish steaks and even whole fish. The only thing that will vary is the cooking time, which will be longer for thicker pieces of fish.</em>) ~1/4 lb is generally a good portion per person.</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Baking sheet</li>
        <li>Parchment paper or aluminum foil (optional)</li>
        <li>Paper towels</li>
        <li>Spoon (optional)</li>
        <li>Oven mitt</li>
        <li>Spatula</li>
      </ul>
        <p>Preheat oven to 450˚F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Pour a drop of extra virgin olive oil onto the prepared baking sheet and rub it in with your hand or a paper towel. Pat fish filets dry with paper towels. (<em>This will prevent food from sticking and make cleanup easier.</em>) Sprinkle fish filets with sea salt and drizzle them with extra virgin olive oil. As you dry each filet, lay it on the prepared baking sheet, being sure to leave a little space between filets, as this will help them to cook evenly. If your fish filets have skin on them, lay the filets skin side-down on the baking sheet. (<em>The skin will come off easily once the fish is cooked.</em>) (<em>Roughly 1-2 teaspoons of oil per small fish filet; about 2 teaspoons to 1 tablespoon per large filet. You basically want to use enough oil to coat the top of the fish. If desired, you can spread the oil over the fish filets using the back of a spoon or your own clean fingers.</em>)
        </p>  
        <p>
        Place baking sheet in the oven and cook until fish filets are fully cooked. For black sea bass, it will take ~10 minutes to cook.Very thin fish, like sole, can take as little as 6-8 minutes to cook. Here’s the best way to check if fish is done cooking: when you suspect that the fish might be ready, carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven. Medium-thick fish filets (like striped bass) can take closer to 12 minutes, while thicker filets (cod, halibut) may take around 15 or 16 minutes. Note, however, that these cooking times are only guidelines, and that they can always vary depending on the size of the fish filets and the strength of your oven. (<em>Be sure to close the oven door promptly.</em>) Press on the fish with the back of a spoon or with your finger. (<em>Make sure your hands are clean and be careful, as the fish may be hot.</em>) If the fish flakes apart easily, it’s cooked. If the fish still seems quite firm, as if it’s pushing back at you rather than falling apart, then it needs to cook a little longer. (<em>Fish filets cook quickly, so you should check on them again every couple minutes.</em>) 
        </p>
        <p>
        When the fish filets are done cooking, gently transfer them to serving plates using a spatula. If you don’t have a spatula, try using a couple large serving spoons. If you want, you can spoon some of the pan juices over the fish. (<em>The juices are very flavorful.</em>)</p>

        <h5>Tomato Salsa</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Ripe tomatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs – basil, mint, etc.</li>
        <li>Sea salt</li>
      </ul>
        <p>Jut up tomatoes in chunks and add to bowl. Add sea salt and let sit. The salt will draw out a lot of water from the tomatoes, which will be helpful in forming the sauce. Add fresh herbs – basil leaves, chopped mint leaves, etc. (<em>When selecting basil, look for basil with smaller leaves, which will be less bitter than larger leaves.</em>) Stir to combine. After the fish filet is out of the oven, top the fish with the salsa. Alternatively, take the fish out a few minutes before ready, top with tomatoes, and roast tomatoes for remainder of cooking time.

      <h4>Side Dishes</h4>
      <div>
      <h5>Crispy Smashed Potatoes with Garlic Scapes</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Small to medium round potatoes (<em>red skinned or Yukon golds are good, but most varieties will work</em>). (<em>When shopping for potatoes, avoid those that have started to sprout.</em>)</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground pepper</li>
        <li>2-3 garlic scapes</li>
        <li>Stockpot</li>
        <li>Colander</li>
        <li>Baking sheet</li>
        <li>Parchment paper or aluminum foil</li>
        <li>Potato masher or meat mallet</li>
      </ul>
        <p>Clean potatoes. Place the potatoes in a pot or saucepan and add enough cold water just to come to the top of the potatoes. Add a big pinch of sea salt to the pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high to high heat and cook until the potatoes are tender. Drain.  (<em>You can check by carefully inserting the tip of a small, sharp knife into some of the potatoes. If the knife slides in easily, the potatoes are cooked. If there’s some resistance, and the potatoes still seem a bit hard, let them cook a little while longer.</em>) Chop up the garlic scapes width-wise into thin pieces. You can chop up the bulb as well. Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Pour a drop of oil onto the prepared baking sheet and rub itin with your hand or a paper towel. Arrange the potatoes on the preparedbaking sheet, leaving plenty of room between them. The potatoes will spreadout a lot when you smash them; use a second baking sheet if necessary. Using a potato masher or a meat mallet, press down on each potato until it’s smashed apart. Drizzle all over with extra virgin olive oil. Sprinkle with coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper. Bake in the oven for at least 30 minutes and as long as 1 hour, or until potatoes are golden and super crispy. ~10 minutes before taking the potatoes out, add the garlic spaces as they take less time to cook.

      <h4>Deserts</h4>
      <h5>Berry Sauce</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Berries (strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, raspberries, or any combination you like)</li>
        <li>Saucepan or small pot</li>
      </ul>
        <p>Rinse berries and throw them in a saucepan or small pot. Cook on your stove over medium-high heat. The berries will quickly begin to give off their juices, and you’ll notice a deep red-purple liquid forming in the pan. Taste and add a couple tablespoons of sugar if needed. Stir to combine. Let the berries continue to simmer in this liquid until the berries are tender (many will dissolve completely) and the liquid has thickened to a slightly syrupy consistency. This usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes. As the sauce cooks, you can dip a spoon into it and taste to see if the sauce needs more sugar. (If you’re using strawberries, remove the hulls – aka leaves – first.) Be careful though, as the sauce is quite hot; allow the sauce to cool slightly before you taste it. If the sauce seems to be boiling too hard, and the liquid splashes around, lower the heat a bit. Remove from heat. Let cool. Refrigerate. This quick and easy sauce makes a perfect topping for ice cream, yogurt, cakes, and more! If you have other fruits on hand (say, peaches or plums) feel free to chop them up and cook them in the sauce as well.</p>
